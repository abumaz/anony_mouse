# anony_mouse
A python script which fills google forms using Selenium library

Features:
1. Options are chosen at random
2. Forms are submitted at a fairly fast pace
3. Useful when you have to get some data for a project, club-work, etc. and still have a lil bit of quota left.
4. Can submit as many times as we want.
5. Has a predefined list of name from which one is chosen at random.

Future Possible Improvements:
1. Implementing a GUI
2. Make it a more universal rather than just for a single format
3. Improvement in speed

How To Use:
1. Copy the link of the google form and enter it in line no. 7.
2. Edit the code manually to match the form's format. [Reffer to selenium docs.](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/index.html)
3. Enter the number of times to submit a respone after executing the script.
4. Let the script do it's work.
